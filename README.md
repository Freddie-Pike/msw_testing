# msw_testing
Playing around with msw(mock service worker).

# How To Run:

## Frontend
In project root:

```
npm i
npm run watch
```

## api
Open two terminals in the `api/` folder after running `npm i `, in 1 terminal run:

```
npm run watch
```

In the other terminal run:

```
npm run dev

The api will then be listening for requests on 3002.
